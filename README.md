This project focuses on developing a system capable of recognizing and completing partially obscured or incomplete shapes. The primary objectives are to identify shapes from images or 3D data, even when portions are missing, and accurately reconstruct the missing parts.

Shape Recognition: The system processes input data to extract key features such as edges and contours. Using deep learning algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for 2D images or PointNet for 3D data, the system classifies the shapes into predefined categories (e.g., circles, triangles, or more complex objects).

Shape Completion: Once a shape is recognized, generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) predict and reconstruct the missing parts. The system ensures that the completed shapes are coherent and visually accurate.

Applications: This technology is applicable in robotics (object manipulation), augmented reality (enhancing object recognition), medical imaging (completing organ scans), and computer-aided design (finishing incomplete sketches).

The project leverages Python, deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, and computer vision tools such as OpenCV, aiming to handle real-time applications and complex shapes with high accuracy.
